# TOP Restourant Page project

###  This is web page representing small fictional japanese yatai ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

image of homepage here!

**Note:** 
This webpage wasa made to be responsive on major desktop screen sizes only!
For this webpage I wanted to get a little bit into web design so I went and learned some figma which, 
I wanted to put to use. So I crafted my first web design using [image of yatai](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50466cffe4b09c5c216a7a1d/1624801928589-P92HUSGX6F5IHYL1ASF2/WhatsApp+Image+2021-04-08+at+12.44.31.jpeg?format=750w;)
and [image of it's menu](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50466cffe4b09c5c216a7a1d/1624803286161-0IM3SKV3NJC9CDKUK067/WhatsApp+Image+2021-04-08+at+12.44.32.jpeg?format=750w;)
that I borrowed from [Betty's blog](https://www.guobetty.com/blog/2021/6/22/blender-self-learning-one-month-progress;) be sure to check it out btw. So i exported it from figma 
and went to work, I also wanted to give something to community so if someone finds my design good enough for their needs they can use it without any restrictions. My main concerns 
for this small project were to use the least possible ammount of javascript lines and to make my webpage responsive for major Desktop screen sizes. Also this is first time that 
I am using svg in practical work and combining them with simple animations.
